Description: The GNU Octave language for numerical computations (2.1 branch)
 Octave is a (mostly Matlab (R) compatible) high-level language, primarily 
 intended for numerical computations. It provides a convenient command-line
 interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically. 
 .
 Octave uses some of the best and most respected numerical libraries as 
 balgen, dassl, eispack, fftpack, lapack, linpack, minpack, odepack, 
 ranlib, slatec-fn and villad. Octave can be dynamically extended with 
 user-supplied C++ files.

 Octave is a (mostly Matlab (R) compatible) high-level language, primarily 
 intended for numerical computations. It provides a convenient command-line
 interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically. 
 .
 This packages provides the following documentation in postscript format:
 the FAQ, a reference card in a4, letter and legal formats, a document on the
 C++ classes used by Octave, as well as the main octave documentation which 
 is also included in info format in the main Octave package.

Description: Header files for the GNU Octave language (2.1 branch)
 Octave is a (mostly Matlab (R) compatible) high-level language, primarily 
 intended for numerical computations. It provides a convenient command-line
 interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically. 
 .
 This packages provides the include files needed to compile and link
 user-supplied code with GNU Octave. If you only write interpreted .m files,
 you do not need this package. 
 .
 The package is "Architecture: any" specific as it contains architecture-
 specific compiler switches in the mkoctfile script.
