    + Since 2.9.12 is marked as the "testing" (AKA "recommended") version
      by the upstream author, the octave virtual package depends now on
      octave2.9.  Since the previous version of this package was
      1:2.1.73-13, we need to add an epoch to the version number in the
      2.9 branch.

    + debian/patches/50_syscalls-test-sleep.dpatch: Increase the amount of

octave2.9 (2.9.6-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/in/PACKAGE.conf: Added code for removing all the directories
    containing octave-forge .m scripts.  This allows octave2.9 and
    octave-forge to be installed together and avoids errors in octave2.9
    such as etime calling an outdated datenum function from octave-forge
    (closes: #375646).

octave2.9 (2.9.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/in/PACKAGE.conf: Renamed from debian/octave.conf.  Contains
    slice directives for initializing the Octave path differently
    according to the branch: for 2.1, use the LOADPATH variable; for 2.9,
    use the addpath function (closes: #373965)
  * debian/control: Build-Depends on slice for doing the above
  * debian/rules: Install $(PACKAGE).conf instead of octave.conf

octave2.9 (2.9.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Thomas Weber ]
  * New upstream release
  * debian/in/control: Don't conflict with octave-forge anymore.  Bug
    #362591 was indeed a problem with the configure script and has been
    fixed upstream.
  * debian/in/octave2.9-00list: Removed from the list the following
    patches:
    - 50_fix-apiversion-2.9.dpatch (applied upstream)
    - 50_system_doc-2.9.dpatch (applied upstream)
    - 50_octave-value-list-resize-2.9.dpatch (this was a gcc bug)
    - 50_automatic-replot-docstring (behaviour changed in 2.9)
    Put a space into the file -- otherwise it's empty and won't get included
    in the diff, thus breaking the build.

  [ Rafael Laboissiere ]
  * debian/in/control:
    - Bumped Standards-Version to 3.7.2 (no changes needed)
    - Constrain build-dependency on g++-4.1 >= 4.1.1-4, because the
      previous version wrongly triggers a "operator delete" compilation
      error  (see bugs #372705, #372152, and #372559).  This is only
      temporary, to insure that the autobuilders will work correctly.  In
      the next version of the package, this build-dependency will be
      dropped.

    for the 2.9 branch, but depends on octave2.1, which is the recommended

    (closes: #324471).

octave2.1 (2.1.71-3) unstable; urgency=low

  +++ Changes by Rafael Laboissiere

  * Recompiled against libhdf5-serial-1.6.4-0c2 and with g++ 4.0.  This
    should complete the C++ ABI transition for the octave2.1 package
    (closes: #327027).
  * Also, once this version will reach unstable, problems with using
    mkoctfile with g++ 4.0 will disappear (closes: #327509).

  * debian/compat: Created this file, containing the compatibility level 4
    for debhelper.  This avoids warning messages from the debhelper
    scripts.
  * debian/rules: Change installation directory from debian/tmp to
    debian/octave2.1 and also gives the later as --sourcedir for the
    dh_movefiles command.  This allows building the package under
    debhelper compatibility level = 4.
  * debian/in/PACKAGE.conffiles, debian/octave2.1.conffiles,
    debian/in/PACKAGE-emacsen.conffiles,
    debian/octave2.1-emacsen.conffiles: Removed files, since debhelper in
    compatibility level 4 adds automatically all files in /etc/ to the
    conffiles file.

  * debian/copyright: Updated Free Software Foundation address.

  * debian/changelog:  Removed all instances of the deprecated
    "[Cc]loses=*" from the package version lines.  Removed all the entries
    before version 1.1.1-7, because they were not in the correct format.
    This legacy material is now in debian/changelog-old.

  * debian/patches/50_no-check-nested-functions.dpatch: Added patch which
    avoid global function definitions to take over local ones (see
    http://www.octave.org/mailing-lists/help-octave/2005/3189).

  * debian/octave-config.1: Removed this file, since there is another one
    upstream which is up-to-date (in doc/interpreter).

  * debian/rules: The octave-config script is now part of the
    octave($version)-headers package.
  * debian/in/PACKAGE.postinst, debian/in/PACKAGE-headers.postinst: Update
    alternatives for octave-config and octave-config.1 in
    octave($version)-headers package instead of octave($version).

octave2.1 (2.1.71-2) unstable; urgency=low

  +++ Changes by Rafael Laboissiere

  * Uploaded to the unstable distribution.  Actually, there was no bump in
    the API version, it is still api-v13
  * This version fixes the FTBFS problem on amd64 using g++ 4.0 related to
    wrong enum declarations in src/lex.l and src/toplevel.cc (closes:
    #314705).
  * debian/in/control: Bumped Standards-Version to 3.6.2. No changes needed.
  * debian/in/PACKAGE.menu: Use full version number for the menu command.
    This makes Lintian happy.

octave2.1 (2.1.71-1) experimental; urgency=low

  +++ Changes by Rafael Laboissiere

  * New upstream release, released to experimental because the API number
    bumped from api-v13 to api-v15.  This makes several other
    Octave-related package unusable and the uploads to unstable must be
    coordinated.
  * debian/in/watch: New template file for debian/watch, which takes into
    account the MAJOR number of the Octave branch (currently either 2.1 or
    2.9).
  * debian/rules (helper-files): Generate debian/watch from
    debian/in/watch
  * debian/in/control: Versioned build-dependency on libhdf5-serial-dev (>=
    1.6.4)

octave2.9 (2.9.2-2) experimental; urgency=low

   +++ Changes by Rafael Laboissiere

  * debian/rules: Do not remove src/gplot.cc in clean target.  This file
    is built upstream from gplot.l using flex and its removal was causing
    the build daemons to fail.

    been applied upstream
  * debian/control: For the octave2.1-doc package, changed mention to
    PostScript to PDF, since the former format is not distributed anymore

octave2.1 (2.1.66-1) unstable; urgency=low

   +++ Changes by Rafael Laboissiere

  * New upstream release
  * debian/control: Build-depend on dpatch
  * debian/rules:
    - Adjust for using dpatch
    - Use compiler flag "-O0" instead of "-O1" for the m68k architecture.
      Let us hope that this will fix the buildd problem on the m68k
      architecture.
    - Removed hack to build the PDF documentation files, since they are
      now built by the upstream Makefile
  * debian/patches/50_build-faq-pdf.dpatch: Added patch for building
    Octave-FAQ.pdf

octave2.1 (2.1.65-1) unstable; urgency=low

  +++ Changes by J. Rafael Rodriguez Galvan:

  * New upstream release 2.1.65 released 24 hours ago

  +++ Changes by Rafael Laboissiere

  * debian/*.postinst.in, debian/*.prerm.in: Moved these files from the
    original *.postinst and *. prerm ones
  * debian/octave2.1.lintian.in: Idem from octave2.1.lintian
  * debian/defs.make, debian/octave-depends: Added files
  * debian/rules:
    - (configure-stamp) Generate *.postinst, *.prerm, and *.lintian by
      replacing the  @VERSION@ string with the current Octave version number
    - (clean) Remove the *.postinst, *.prerm, *.lintian files generated
      automatically
    - (install) Install files defs.make and octave-depends in
      octave2.1-headers package
  * Install PDF documentation files instead of the PS ones.  There is a
    pdfdocs variable in debian/rules now that control which files are
    built/installed.  Build-Depends on tetex-bin. (Closes: #293562)

  +++ Changes by Adam Conrad:

  * Add logic to debian/rules and debian/control to make sure that
    octave2.1-headers depends on f2c on m68k (closes: #292917)

octave2.1 (2.1.64-3) unstable; urgency=low

  +++ Changes by Rafael Laboissiere:

  * debian/rules: Get the logic around octave-bug.in right.  This was
    causing a FTBFS in all architectures because the test failed and,
    consequently, make failed (closes: #292403).
  * debian/changelog: Start using "Debian Octave Group" in the signature
    of entries.  Also, added Emacs variable settings at the end, handy
    when using debian-changelog-mode.  This avoids two warnings issued by
    Lintian regarding mismatch between maintainer and uploader, and the
    necessity to document NMU.

octave2.1 (2.1.64-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Uploaded in behalf of the new maintainer of the octave2.1 packages: the
    Debian Octave Group <pkg-octave-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org>
  * debian/control:
    - Changed Maintainer
    - Build-depends on libreadline5-dev
    - octave2.1-headers depends on libreadline5-dev
    - Lower-cased the first word and removed some "The" words in the short
      description of packages, as per the Developers Reference, section
      6.2.2.  This makes Lintian happy.
  * debian/rules:
    - (clean) Inverse the order of the calls to rm libcruft/*/Makefile and
      make distclean.  This was causing several *.o in libcruft to be left
      after debian/rules clean, which resulted in dpkg-source breakage when
      building the diff.gz package file.
    - (configure) Save the original octave-bug.in file as octave-bug.in.orig
      prior to the tempfile substitution
    - (clean) Restore octave-bug.in.orig as octave-bug.in, such that the
      patch does not end up in the diff.gz file

octave2.1 (2.1.51-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version octave 2.1.51 released today

  * This represents a fairly major change from the last release. Quoting from
    the announcement:
       This version has many new features and bug fixes.  The biggest change
       is that N-d arrays (for numbers, structs, and cells) are mostly
       working, though there are some significant features that still need to
       be implemented.  For example, the [] operator will fail to concatenate
       N-d arrays, but we hope to fix this for 2.1.52.  If you find that
       another of your favorite N-d array operations doesn't work, please
       mention it so we can have some idea of what features are missed the
       most.
    See http://www.octave.org/mailing-lists/octave-maintainers/2003/353
    for the full announcement, or the upstream ChangeLog in the package.

octave2.1 (2.1.49-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * As we managed to get octave2.1 compiled on m68k (using f2c) and on
    hppa (using gcc/g++ 3.3), let's remove the last problem: hdf5 which has

octave2.1 (2.1.48-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: Hardwire Depends: on gcc et al to 3.2 as some of
    Octave's C++ code is not yet ready for release 3.3 of g++
  * debian/rules: After days of experimenting with crest.debian.org (scoring
    an impressive 96 bogomips), we found that g77 -O0 and -O2 really don't
    work for m68k on some of the legacy Fortran, but miracously f2c -O1 does
    -- and so does gcc -O1. Luckily it only took about 26 hours for each
    'make' run, and I am really glad that Debian Policy more or less forces
    me to care so much about m68k. If only there were any users for this
    architecture ...
    .
    Needless to say, it is somewhat sad that this recompilation is forced
    upon the other architectures on which gcc/g++/g77 are working just fine.
    Oh the things one has to do to get Octave back into Debian testing.

  * debian/rules: Don't let dh_installemacsen modify postinst and prerm,
    rather use our previous code which first tests for emacsen-commen so
    that we don't have to depend on it (Closes: #44924)

octave (2.0.13.96-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Starting with this release of the Debian package, Octave is linked
    against Debian's copy of libreadline (instead of its own) as Debian's
    libreadline package now provides all the needed symbols (fixes #27707)
  * debian/shlibs.local: Added to depend on libreadline2g-2.1-13

  * debian/rules: Added powerpc support. Thanks to Konstantinos
    Margaritis <kmargar@cc.uoa.gr> for the patch.

  * Applied (modified) patch by Rafael Laboissiere <rafael@icp.inpg.fr> to
    emacsen install script for [x]emacs handling of 'no-site-file' script
  * While this does not formally close an open Debian bug, it should go
    into frozen as the previous four pre-releases of Octave-2.0.14

 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Fri,  4 Dec 1998 20:44:57 -0500

octave (2.0.13.93-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgraded to fourth pre-release of Octave 2.0.14 which contains
    an upstream bug fix to Bessel function arguments
  * Built properly with upstream sources in octave_2.0.13.93.orig.tar.gz
    so that a .diff.gz is built (fixes #29674)

 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Nov 1998 19:51:24 -0500

octave (2.0.13.92-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgraded to third pre-release of Octave 2.0.14
  * Among other things, this defines __NO_MATH_INLINES to prevent the use
    of inlines in /usr/include/__math.h which cannot cope with expressions
    like exp(Inf). My thanks to John Eaton for having debugged this, on my
    computer ;-) (fixed #27516)

 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Fri,  6 Nov 1998 23:35:06 -0500

octave (2.0.13-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recompiled under egcs_2.91.57 and libstdc++_2.91.57 (fixes #26776)
  * Changed cursor keybindings for inferior-octave-mode to comments in
    /etc/emacs/site-start.d/50octave.el; now the Emacs mode for Octave is
    consistent with other comint modes, on the other hand, the code that is
    commented out makes the mode consistent with Octave's own shell. The
    difference is whether cursor keys or M-p,M-n are used to scroll
    through the readline history (fixes #26468)
  * Applied patch by Mumit Khan for use with newer egcs compiler
    (http://www.che.wisc.edu/octave/mailing-lists/bug-octave/1998/270)
  * Changed debian/rules to also install ChangeLog file from

 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Fri, 17 Jul 1998 18:21:34 -0400

octave (2.0.13-4) frozen unstable; urgency=medium

  * Applied patch by Roman Hodek <Roman.Hodek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>
    to configure{,.in} to also use the -rpath linker option on non-Intel
    Linux systems to allow for dynamic linking of Octave libraries. While
    this change does not affect i386 systems, it fixes an important bug for
    other Debian architectures and should go into frozen (fixes #23674)
  * Changed debian/rules to use --with-f2c argument for configure under
    m68k, and --with-g77 (from the egcs suite) under i386, sparc and alpha.

 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Fri, 19 Jun 1998 19:47:42 -0400

octave (2.0.13-3) unstable; urgency=low

    directory to emacs load-path

 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Mon, 25 May 1998 20:16:24 -0400

  * Adapted to new Emacsen policy (fixes #20372, #21222)
  * Converted debian/rules to debhelper

 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Apr 1998 18:28:31 -0400

octave (2.0.11.92-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed dependency on info to "info (>= 3.12)"

 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Fri, 17 Apr 1998 18:44:10 -0400

octave (2.0.11.92-2) unstable; urgency=low,

  * Added Depends: on "info (>= 3.12-1) | info-browser" to debian/control
    as Octave no longer comes with an info binary
  * Added explicit setting of INFO_PROGRAM = "/usr/bin/info" to
    /etc/octave.conf as the default INFO_PROGRAM still points to the old
    location

 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Apr 1998 22:46:32 -0400

octave (2.0.11.92-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgraded to new upstream test-release 2.0.11.92

octave (2.0.11.91-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgraded to new upstream test-release 2.0.11.91
  * This fixes a couple of small bugs, one of them dear to to fellow
    Debianer Jim van Zandt, and as a test-release might as well go into
    our current 'unstable' distribution. I have used previous pre-releases
    and they work just as well --- call it the pre-patch methodology
    spreading into application space ;-)

 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Apr 1998 11:51:56 -0400

octave (2.0.11-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Compilation with new gcc/g77/g++ 2.90.26 based on egcs
  * Changed debian/rules by adding a Perl one-liner substition so that
    /usr/bin/octave-bug will use tempfile(1) to create a temporary
    filename; also sent the sources for debianutils-1.8 upstream so that
    they might be included in the next release (fixes #19804)

 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Mar 1998 18:41:12 -0500

octave (2.0.11-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgraded to new upstream version

 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Wed, 25 Feb 1998 18:33:04 -0500

octave (2.0.10-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Compilation with f2c instead of g77 in order to get a libc6 version
    going (see bug report #17963 filed against g77)

  * Added Replaces: octave (<= 2.0.5-2) to control for octave-staticlibs
    to cleanly replace the static libraries from the older octave package
    as well as an explicit version number for the Depends: on octave
    (thanks to Richard Braakman for the hints)

  * Fixed FSF address in copyright (lintian)
  * Made octave.rc to /etc/octave.conf symlink absolute (lintian)
  * Created links to ../man7/undocumented.7.gz in lieu of manual pages
    for the two utility scripts octave-bug and mkoctfile (lintian)

 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Wed, 25 Feb 1998 18:32:27 -0500

octave (2.0.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgraded to new upstream version

  * This version is compiled on a libc5 system as g77/gcc and eg77/egcc
    (including the new {gcc,g77}_2.90.23-1) both die on some legacy
    Fortran code on a libc6 system. Major bummer.

 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Sun, 8 Feb 1998 17:05:07 -0500

octave (2.0.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Compiled with GNU libc2 aka libc6 (fixes bug #11739)

octave (2.0.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * added creation of /usr/local/share/octave/site-m in the postinst if
    /usr/local filesystem is writable and removal of the directories
    /usr/local/share/octave/site-m and /usr/local/share/octave/site-m in
    the prerm if they are empty to reflect Debian policy on /usr/local/
  * moved configuration file /usr/share/octave/site/m/startup/octaverc
    into /etc/octave.conf and provided a softlink from the default location
  * added LOADPATH setting to octave.conf aka octaverc for the local tree
  * made /etc/octave.conf a conffile
  * moved static libs into a seperate package (which is not needed for
    normal use of octave) --- this saves 4.4 MB of diskspace
  * patched mkoctfile.in to add a flag for stripping to /usr/bin/mkoctfile
  * changed configure to explicit setting of host architecture

 -- Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>  Sun, 27 Apr 1997 19:06:03 -0400

octave (2.0.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * rewrote debian/rules:
    - configure for dynamic loading, shared libs  and lite kernel which
      allows dynamic extension of the octave language via user provided
      C++ programs; examples are in /usr/doc/octave/examples
    - configure prefix /usr; install prefix debian/tmp/usr (fixes bug #8139)
    - configure for libs in /usr/lib/octave to avoid clashed
    - include upstream postscript docs
