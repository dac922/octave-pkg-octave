@c FIXME -- someday, we might replace this with @backslashchar, which
@c has been added to Texinfo.

@macro xbackslashchar
\\
@end macro

@c The following macro is used for the on-line help system, but we don't
@c want lots of `See also: foo, bar, and baz' strings cluttering the
@c printed manual (that information should be in the supporting text for
@c each group of functions and variables).
@c
@c Implementation Note:
@c For TeX, @vskip produces a nice separation.
@c For Texinfo '@sp 1' should work, but in practice produces ugly results
@c for HTML.  We use a simple blank line to produce the correct behavior. 

@macro seealso {args}
@iftex
@vskip 2pt
@end iftex
@ifnottex

@end ifnottex
@noindent
@strong{See also:} \args\.
@end macro

@c The following macro marks words that aspell should ignore during
@c spellchecking.  Within Texinfo it has no effect as it merely replaces
@c the macro call with the argument itself.

@macro nospell {arg}
\arg\
@end macro

@c The following macro works around a situation where the Info/plain text
@c expansion of the @code{XXX} macro is `XXX'.  The use of the apostrophe
@c can be confusing if the code segment itself ends with a transpose operator.
@ifinfo
@macro xcode{arg}
\arg\
@end macro
@end ifinfo
@ifnotinfo
@macro xcode{arg}
@code{\arg\}
@end macro
@end ifnotinfo
