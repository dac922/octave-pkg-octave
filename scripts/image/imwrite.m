## Write images in various file formats.
##
## The image @var{img} can be a binary, grayscale, RGB, or multi-dimensional
## image.  The size and class of @var{img} should be the same as what should
## be expected when reading it with @code{imread}: the 3rd and 4th dimensions
## reserved for color space, and multiple pages respectively.  If it's an
## indexed image, the colormap @var{map} must also be specified.
##
## If @var{ext} is not supplied, the file extension of @var{filename} is used
## to determine the format.  The actual supported formats are dependent on
## options made during the build of Octave.  Use @code{imformats} to check
## the support of the different image formats.
##
## Depending on the file format, it is possible to configure the writing
## of images with @var{param}, @var{val} pairs.  The following options
## are supported:
##
## @table @samp
## @item Alpha
## Alpha (transparency) channel for the image.  This must be a matrix with
## same class, and number of rows and columns of @var{img}.  In case of a
## multipage image, the size of the 4th dimension must also match and the third
## dimension must be a singleton.  By default, image will be completely
## opaque.
##
## @item Quality
## Set the quality of the compression.  The value should be an
## integer between 0 and 100, with larger values indicating higher visual
## quality and lower compression.  Defaults to 75.
##
## @item WriteMode
## Some file formats, such as TIFF and GIF, are able to store multiple
## images in a single file.  This option specifies if @var{img} should be
## appended to the file (if it exists) or if a new file should be created
## for it (possibly overwriting an existing file).  The value should be
## the string @qcode{"Overwrite"} (default), or @qcode{"Append"}.
##
## Despite this option, the most efficient method of writing a multipage
## image is to pass a 4 dimensional @var{img} to @code{imwrite}, the
## same matrix that could be expected when using @code{imread} with the
## option @qcode{"Index"} set to @qcode{"all"}.
