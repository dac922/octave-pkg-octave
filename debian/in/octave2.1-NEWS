octave2.1 (1:2.1.73-18) unstable; urgency=low

    The recommended branch of Octave is 3.0.  The 2.1 branch is now
    deprecated and the octave2.1* packages will be dropped from Debian
    after the release of Lenny.  Users should migrate all their scripts to
    Octave 3.0.*.  See /usr/share/doc/octave3.0/NEWS.gz for details.
