@chapter Polynomial Manipulations

In Octave, a polynomial is represented by its coefficients (arranged
in descending order).  For example, a vector @var{c} of length
@math{N+1} corresponds to the following polynomial of order
@tex
 $N$
$$
 p (x) = c_1 x^N + \ldots + c_N x + c_{N+1}.
$$
@end tex
@ifinfo
 @var{N}

@example
p(x) = @var{c}(1) x^@var{N} + @dots{} + @var{c}(@var{N}) x + @var{c}(@var{N}+1).
@end example
@end ifinfo

@node Evaluating Polynomials
@section Evaluating Polynomials

The value of a polynomial represented by the vector @var{c} can be evaluated
at the point @var{x} very easily, as the following example shows:

@example
@group
N = length(c)-1;
val = dot( x.^(N:-1:0), c );
@end group
@end example

@noindent
While the above example shows how easy it is to compute the value of a
polynomial, it isn't the most stable algorithm.  With larger polynomials
you should use more elegant algorithms, such as Horner's Method, which
is exactly what the Octave function @code{polyval} does.

In the case where @var{x} is a square matrix, the polynomial given by
@var{c} is still well-defined.  As when @var{x} is a scalar the obvious
implementation is easily expressed in Octave, but also in this case
more elegant algorithms perform better.  The @code{polyvalm} function
provides such an algorithm.

@c ./polynomial/polyval.m
@anchor{doc-polyval}
@deftypefn {Function File} {@var{y} =} polyval (@var{p}, @var{x})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {@var{y} =} polyval (@var{p}, @var{x}, [], @var{mu})
Evaluate the polynomial at of the specified values for @var{x}.  When @var{mu}
is present evaluate the polynomial for (@var{x}-@var{mu}(1))/@var{mu}(2).
If @var{x} is a vector or matrix, the polynomial is evaluated for each of
the elements of @var{x}.
@deftypefnx {Function File} {[@var{y}, @var{dy}] =} polyval (@var{p}, @var{x}, @var{s})
@deftypefnx {Function File} {[@var{y}, @var{dy}] =} polyval (@var{p}, @var{x}, @var{s}, @var{mu})
In addition to evaluating the polynomial, the second output 
represents the prediction interval, @var{y} +/- @var{dy}, which
contains at least 50% of the future predictions.  To calculate the
prediction interval, the structured variable @var{s}, originating
form `polyfit', must be present.

Evaluate a polynomial in the matrix sense.

@code{polyvalm (@var{c}, @var{x})} will evaluate the polynomial in the
matrix sense, i.e., matrix multiplication is used instead of element by
element multiplication as is used in polyval.

The argument @var{x} must be a square matrix.

@node Finding Roots
@section Finding Roots

Octave can find the roots of a given polynomial.  This is done by computing
the companion matrix of the polynomial (see the @code{compan} function
for a definition), and then finding its eigenvalues.

@c ./polynomial/roots.m
@anchor{doc-roots}
@deftypefn {Function File} {} roots (@var{v})

For a vector @var{v} with @math{N} components, return
the roots of the polynomial
@tex
$$
v_1 z^{N-1} + \cdots + v_{N-1} z + v_N.
$$
@end tex
@ifnottex

@example
v(1) * z^(N-1) + @dots{} + v(N-1) * z + v(N)
@end example
@end ifnottex

As an example, the following code finds the roots of the quadratic
polynomial
@tex
$$ p(x) = x^2 - 5. $$
@end tex
@ifnottex
@example
p(x) = x^2 - 5.
@end example
@end ifnottex
@example
@group
c = [1, 0, -5];
roots(c)

@result{} -2.2361
@end group
@end example
Note that the true result is
@tex
$\pm \sqrt{5}$
@end tex
@ifnottex
@math{+/- sqrt(5)}
@end ifnottex
which is roughly
@tex
$\pm 2.2361$.

vector @var{c}.

The companion matrix is

@deftypefnx {Function File} {[@var{multp}, @var{indx}] =} mpoles (@var{p}, @var{tol}, @var{reorder})
Identify unique poles in @var{p} and associates their multiplicity,
ordering them from largest to smallest.

If the relative difference of the poles is less than @var{tol}, then
they are considered to be multiples.  The default value for @var{tol}
is 0.001.

If the optional parameter @var{reorder} is zero, poles are not sorted.

The value @var{multp} is a vector specifying the multiplicity of the
poles.  @var{multp}(:) refers to multiplicity of @var{p}(@var{indx}(:)).

For example,

@example
@group
p = [2 3 1 1 2];
[m, n] = mpoles(p);
  @result{} m = [1; 1; 2; 1; 2]
  @result{} n = [2; 5; 1; 4; 3]

Together with deconv, you can reduce a ratio of two polynomials.
Tolerance defaults to 
@example 
sqrt(eps).

represented by the residues, poles, and a direct polynomial specified
by @var{r}, @var{p} and @var{k}, and the pole multiplicity @var{e}.

If the multiplicity, @var{e}, is not explicitly specified the multiplicity is
determined by the script mpoles.m.

@node Polynomial Interpolation
@section Polynomial Interpolation

Octave comes with good support for various kinds of interpolation,
most of which are described in @ref{Interpolation}.  One simple alternative
to the functions described in the aforementioned chapter, is to fit
a single polynomial to some given data points.  To avoid a highly
fluctuating polynomial, one most often wants to fit a low-order polynomial
to data.  This usually means that it is necessary to fit the polynomial
in a least-squares sense, which is what the @code{polyfit} function does.

@c ./polynomial/polyfit.m
@anchor{doc-polyfit}
@deftypefn {Function File} {[@var{p}, @var{s}, @var{mu}] =} polyfit (@var{x}, @var{y}, @var{n})
Return the coefficients of a polynomial @var{p}(@var{x}) of degree
@var{n} that minimizes the least-squares-error of the fit.

The polynomial coefficients are returned in a row vector.

The second output is a structure containing the following fields:

@table @samp
@item R
Triangular factor R from the QR decomposition.
@item X
The Vandermonde matrix used to compute the polynomial coefficients.
@item df
The degrees of freedom.
@item normr
The norm of the residuals.
@item yf
The values of the polynomial for each value of @var{x}.
@end table

The second output may be used by @code{polyval} to calculate the 
statistical error limits of the predicted values.

When the third output, @var{mu}, is present the 
coefficients, @var{p}, are associated with a polynomial in
@var{xhat} = (@var{x}-@var{mu}(1))/@var{mu}(2).
Where @var{mu}(1) = mean (@var{x}), and @var{mu}(2) = std (@var{x}).
This linear transformation of @var{x} improves the numerical
stability of the fit.
@seealso{@ref{doc-polyval,,polyval}, @ref{doc-residue,,residue}}
@end deftypefn


In situations where a single polynomial isn't good enough, a solution
is to use several polynomials pieced together.  The function @code{mkpp}
creates a piece-wise polynomial, @code{ppval} evaluates the function 
created by @code{mkpp}, and @code{unmkpp} returns detailed information
about the function.

The following example shows how to combine two linear functions and a
quadratic into one function.  Each of these functions is expressed
on adjoined intervals.

@example
@group
x = [-2, -1, 1, 2];
p = [ 0,  1, 0;
      1, -2, 1;
      0, -1, 1 ];
pp = mkpp(x, p);
xi = linspace(-2, 2, 50);
yi = ppval(pp, xi);
plot(xi, yi);
@end group
@end example

@c ./polynomial/ppval.m
@anchor{doc-ppval}
@deftypefn {Function File} {@var{yi} =} ppval (@var{pp}, @var{xi})
Evaluate piece-wise polynomial @var{pp} at the points @var{xi}.  
If @code{@var{pp}.d} is a scalar greater than 1, or an array,
then the returned value @var{yi} will be an array that is 
@code{d1, d1, @dots{}, dk, length (@var{xi})]}.

Construct a piece-wise polynomial structure from sample points
@var{x} and coefficients @var{p}.  The i-th row of @var{p},
@code{@var{p} (@var{i},:)}, contains the coefficients for the polynomial
over the @var{i}-th interval, ordered from highest to 
lowest.  There must be one row for each interval in @var{x}, so 
@code{rows (@var{p}) == length (@var{x}) - 1}.  

You can concatenate multiple polynomials of the same order over the 
same set of intervals using @code{@var{p} = [ @var{p1}; @var{p2}; 
@dots{}; @var{pd} ]}.  In this case, @code{rows (@var{p}) == @var{d} 
* (length (@var{x}) - 1)}.

@var{d} specifies the shape of the matrix @var{p} for all except the
last dimension.  If @var{d} is not specified it will be computed as
@code{round (rows (@var{p}) / (length (@var{x}) - 1))} instead.

Extract the components of a piece-wise polynomial structure @var{pp}.
These are as follows:

@table @asis
@item @var{x}
Sample points.
@item @var{p}
Polynomial coefficients for points in sample interval.  @code{@var{p}
(@var{i}, :)} contains the coefficients for the polynomial over
interval @var{i} ordered from highest to lowest.  If @code{@var{d} >
1}, @code{@var{p} (@var{r}, @var{i}, :)} contains the coefficients for 
the r-th polynomial defined on interval @var{i}.  However, this is 
stored as a 2-D array such that @code{@var{c} = reshape (@var{p} (:,
@var{j}), @var{n}, @var{d})} gives @code{@var{c} (@var{i},  @var{r})}
is the j-th coefficient of the r-th polynomial over the i-th interval.
@item @var{n}
Number of polynomial pieces.
@item @var{k}
Order of the polynomial plus 1.
@item @var{d}
Number of polynomials defined for each interval.

@deftypefn {Function File} {} poly (@var{a})
If @var{a} is a square @math{N}-by-@math{N} matrix, @code{poly (@var{a})}
is the row vector of the coefficients of @code{det (z * eye (N) - a)},
the characteristic polynomial of @var{a}.  As an example we can use
this to find the eigenvalues of @var{a} as the roots of @code{poly (@var{a})}.
@example
@group
roots(poly(eye(3)))
@result{} 1.00000 + 0.00000i
@result{} 1.00000 - 0.00000i
@result{} 1.00000 + 0.00000i
@end group
@end example
In real-life examples you should, however, use the @code{eig} function
for computing eigenvalues.

If @var{x} is a vector, @code{poly (@var{x})} is a vector of coefficients
of the polynomial whose roots are the elements of @var{x}.  That is,
of @var{c} is a polynomial, then the elements of 
@code{@var{d} = roots (poly (@var{c}))} are contained in @var{c}.
The vectors @var{c} and @var{d} are, however, not equal due to sorting
and numerical errors.
