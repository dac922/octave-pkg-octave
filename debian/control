Description: GNU Octave language for numerical computations (2.1 branch)
 Octave is a (mostly Matlab (R) compatible) high-level language, primarily
 intended for numerical computations. It provides a convenient command-line
 interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.
 .
 Octave uses some of the best and most respected numerical libraries as
 balgen, dassl, eispack, fftpack, lapack, linpack, minpack, odepack,
 ranlib, slatec-fn and villad. Octave can be dynamically extended with
 user-supplied C++ files.
