## This file should contain any commands that should be executed each
## time Octave starts for every user at this site.

## On a Debian GNU/Linux system, Octave also searches for local files and
## directories below /usr/local/share/octave/site-m/.  Please see the Octave
## documentation for other variables you might want to set here.
