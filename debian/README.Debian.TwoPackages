 /usr/share/octave/site/exec
                  /site/oct      

	is accessed by both versions -- if you scripts or .oct files conflict 
        between the two, I suggest that you version these and set the
        LOADPATH accordingly

 If you have two packages installed, make sure you call the correct mkoctfile 
and octave bug
